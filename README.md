## Dataset
I used the Electric Vehicle Specifications dataset from Kaggle:

(Note: dataset not uploaded here; open the link to download.)

### What I did (Week 1)
- Imported dataset into Google Colab
- Performed initial cleaning (duplicates & basic NA handling)
- Conducted EDA: histograms, scatter plots, top-brands bar chart, correlation heatmap
- Key observations:
  - Most EVs are sedans/SUVs
  - Higher battery capacity → higher range
  - Fast-charging power varies by model
  - Several technical fields contain missing values
